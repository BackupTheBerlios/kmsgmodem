Thank you for using this Program.

As your surely understand I take no warranty for any soft- or hardware damages.

Since Version 0.3 you need Sound eXchange (SoX) to listen to the voice messages.
You also need KFax from the kdegraphics package.

You can mail me your suggestions, bug reports, wishes, etc. to wirr@users.berlios.de,
or get to the forums at http://kmsgmodem.berlios.de and post it there.
